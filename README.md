PushCo
====

PushCo is a wrapper for [Push.co](http://push.co/)'s API. For now, the class only supports ["Post notifications"](http://push.co/api/push) for a specific "Push App". 

## How to use
I added an example use in `example.php`. Just look at `push.php` for more information. The code should be self-explaining.

## License
No license of course. Feel free to use it anywhere you want. But a short message is appreciated!
