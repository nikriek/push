PushCo
====

PushCo is a wrapper for [Push.co](http://push.co/)'s API. For now, the class only supports ["Post notifications"](http://push.co/api/push) for a specific "Push App". 

## How to use
The PushCo currently only exists in PHP and Python. I will add more languages in the future.

All folders consist of two files:

* `push.EXTENSION` – Libray
* `example.EXTENSION` – Example

## License
No license of course. Feel free to use it anywhere you want. But a short message is appreciated!
